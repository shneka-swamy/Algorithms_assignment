# Algorithms_assignment

This code aims at creating a full binary tree given the left and the right nodes of the subtree as arrays. All the arrays use preorder traversal. (binary_tree_5)

Given the number of internal nodes find all the binary trees. (left and right pinter representation). (binary_tree_2)
